Today I saw some birds come onto the feeder in the garden, including a robin, some blue-tits and a coal-tit. I now have a squirrel-proof feeder which means only the birds get to eat the sweet, sweet seed within. The blue-tits are picky though and throw seed onto the floor, unfortunately this means that pidgeons now hang around waiting for floor-seed swiping opportunities.
